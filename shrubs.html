                    <h4>Lilac</h4>
                    <p>The lilac, or Syringa vulgaris, falls within the olive family, which also includes jasmine,
                        Forsythia, and privet. It grows from a large deciduous shrub that blooms in spring. While it
                        is
                        native to the Balkan Peninsula, it has been spread throughout parts of Asia, Europe, and
                        North
                        America. The common name lilac descends from several different languages all the way back to
                        the
                        Persian words meaning “indigo” or “dark blue”.
                        <br>There are over one thousand varieties of lilac and two hundred species. Lilacs are also
                        edible and can be made into things like lilac sugar, syrup, or even wine. These flowers are
                        symbols of love, hope, and new beginnings. In Greek mythology, lilacs are said to have been
                        formed from the tears of a nymph named Syringa, who transformed herself into the very same
                        plant
                        to escape the unwanted advances of the Greek god named Pan.

                    <h4>Rose</h4>
                    <p>Roses, belonging to the Rosaceae family, share their lineage with apples, pears, and almonds.
                        These perennial shrubs or climbers can bloom in various seasons, depending on their species.
                        Originating from regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North
                        America, roses have been cultivated and cherished worldwide. The name "rose" comes from the
                        Latin "rosa," a term that has been embraced by many languages.
                        <br>With over three hundred species and thousands of cultivars, roses are celebrated not
                        only
                        for their beauty and fragrance but also for their culinary uses. They are edible in the
                        sense
                        that they can be made into rose water, jam, and tea. Symbolizing a range of ideas, from love
                        and
                        beauty to passion and sorrow, roses hold a special place in many cultures.In Greek
                        mythology,
                        the rose is linked to Aphrodite, the goddess of love, who is said to have created the flower
                        from her tears and the blood of her lover, Adonis.

                    <h4>Azalea</h4>
                    <p>Azaleas are flowering shrubs within the genus Rhododendron and part of the family Ericaceae.
                        They
                        bloom in spring and their blossoms often last several weeks. Azalea flowers come in a
                        variety of
                        vibrant colors, including red, purple, pink, white, and others. Most kinds of Azalea are
                        deciduous, so they shed their leaves in the fall. There are hundreds of varieties that come
                        in
                        range of forms and sizes, and can be found in North America as well as parts of Asia and
                        Europe.
                        They are shade preferring plants, and often grow under or near trees.
                        <br>While beautiful, azaleas are highly toxic. In fact, Azaleas and rhododendrons were once
                        so
                        well known for their toxicity, that it was a known death threat to recieve a boquet in a
                        black
                        vase. The name azalea originates greece, meaning dry, a reference to its quick-draining
                        habit.
                        It has a wide range of symbolsim stemming from different cultures, including good fortune,
                        care
                        for loved ones, harmony, and more. According to mythology, there was once a young prince who
                        fell in love with a princess, but she was cursed to become an azalea bush. The prince's love
                        and
                        devotion for her eventually broke the curse and she turned back.

                    <h4>Mountain Laurel</h4>
                    <p>Mountain laurel, or Kalmia latifolia, is an evergreen shrub belonging to the heath family,
                        Ericaceae, which also includes rhododendrons and blueberries. Native to eastern North
                        America,
                        it thrives in mountainous and woodland areas, often growing in dense thickets. Blooming in
                        late
                        spring to early summer, its distinctive flowers range in color from pale pink to deep rose,
                        with
                        delicate markings resembling intricate patterns. The plant’s glossy, dark green leaves
                        remain
                        vibrant year-round, adding to its appeal as an ornamental shrub. However, all parts of
                        mountain
                        laurel are highly toxic to humans and animals if ingested.
                        <br>Symbolically, mountain laurel represents perseverance, ambition, and protection. It was
                        named after Pehr Kalm, a Swedish botanist who studied North American flora in the 18th
                        century.
                        Indigenous peoples valued the plant for its resilience, and it was sometimes used in
                        ceremonies
                        or as a protective charm. According to Appalachian folklore, a young woman once wove a crown
                        of
                        mountain laurel to guide her lost love home, but when he never returned, the flowers turned
                        from
                        white to pink, reflecting her sorrow. Today, mountain laurel is cherished for its beauty and
                        is
                        even recognized as the state flower of Pennsylvania and Connecticut.
