                        They bloom in spring and their blossoms often last several weeks. Azalea flowers come in a
                        variety of vibrant colors, including red, purple, pink, white, and others. Most kinds of Azalea
                        are deciduous, so they shed their leaves in the fall. There are hundreds of varieties that come
                        in range of forms and sizes, and can be found in North America as well as parts of Asia and
                        Europe. They are shade preferring plants, and often grow under or near trees. While beautiful,
                        azaleas are highly toxic. In fact, Azaleas and rhododendrons were once so well known for their
                        toxicity, that it was a known death threat to receive a bouquet in a black vase. The name azalea
                        originates from Greece, meaning dry, a reference to its quick-draining habit. It has a wide
                        range of symbolism stemming from different cultures, including good fortune, care for loved
                        ones, harmony, and more. According to mythology, there was once a young prince who fell in love
                        with a princess, but she was cursed to become an azalea bush. The prince's love and devotion for
                        her eventually broke the curse and she turned back.</td>

                        also includes roses, apples, and peaches. These delicate flowers bloom in early spring, often
                        before their leaves fully emerge. Native to East Asia, particularly Japan, China, and Korea,
                        cherry blossoms have become a symbol of renewal and fleeting beauty. While they are most
                        commonly associated with pale pink hues, some varieties produce white or even darker pink
                        blossoms. The trees are typically ornamental, though some species do bear small, inedible fruit.
                        Cherry blossoms hold deep cultural significance, especially in Japan, where the annual hanami
                        tradition involves gathering under the trees to appreciate their short-lived beauty. The flowers
                        are often linked to themes of impermanence and the transient nature of life, a concept rooted in
                        Buddhist teachings. According to Japanese folklore, a spirit once inhabited a cherry tree, and
                        when a kind-hearted samurai saved it from destruction, the tree burst into breathtaking blossoms
                        as a sign of gratitude. Today, cherry blossoms remain a beloved symbol worldwide, often planted
                        in parks and gardens as a reminder of nature’s fleeting wonders.</td>

                        cultivated around the world for centuries. These perennials produce bright yellow, white, or
                        orange trumpet-shaped flowers, emerging from bulbs that lie dormant through the winter.
                        Daffodils thrive in a variety of environments, from wild meadows to carefully tended gardens,
                        and they are known for their ability to naturalize and spread over time. Daffodils are often
                        associated with rebirth, new beginnings, and unyielding hope. Their name, Narcissus, originates
                        from Greek mythology, telling the story of a beautiful youth who fell in love with his own
                        reflection and was transformed into a flower upon his death. In many cultures, daffodils are
                        seen as a harbinger of good fortune, particularly in Wales, where spotting the first daffodil of
                        the season is believed to bring prosperity for the year ahead. Despite their cheerful
                        appearance, daffodils are toxic when consumed, making them both a symbol of joy and a reminder
                        of nature’s hidden dangers.</td>

                        their springtime display of blossoms, which are typically white or pink. However, what appear to
                        be petals are actually bracts, specialized leaves that surround the true, less conspicuous
                        flowers. The foliage often turns vibrant shades of red and purple in the fall, adding to the
                        plant's seasonal interest. Many species also produce attractive berries that provide food for
                        wildlife. In various cultures, dogwoods symbolize durability and resilience. In Christian
                        tradition, the dogwood is linked to the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; legend suggests that the
                        tree was once large and sturdy, but after being used to construct the cross, it was transformed
                        into a smaller, more delicate form as a sign of humility and repentance. In the language of
                        flowers, dogwoods convey messages of affection and steadfastness. Their graceful appearance and

                        for its soothing fragrance. Lavender flowers appear in shades of purple, though some varieties
                        bloom in pink, blue, or white. The plant is widely cultivated for its essential oils, which are
                        used in perfumes, herbal remedies, and even culinary applications. Lavender has long been
                        associated with tranquility, protection, and purification. In ancient Rome, it was prized for
                        its cleansing properties, often added to bathwater to promote relaxation. The plant’s name is
                        derived from the Latin word lavare, meaning “to wash.” Many cultures believe lavender wards off
                        evil spirits and bad luck, while others see it as a symbol of love and devotion. A medieval
                        legend tells of a young healer who planted lavender around her village, keeping illness at bay
                        and bringing peace to those who lived there. Today, lavender remains a popular herb for

                        America. The common name lilac descends from several different languages all the way back to the
                        Persian words meaning “indigo” or “dark blue”. There are over one thousand varieties of lilac
                        and two hundred species. Lilacs are also edible and can be made into things like lilac sugar,
                        syrup, or even wine. These flowers are symbols of love, hope, and new beginnings. In Greek
                        mythology, lilacs are said to have been formed from the tears of a nymph named Syringa, who
                        transformed herself into the very same plant to escape the unwanted advances of the Greek god
                        named Pan.</td>

                        fragrant flowers, which can be white, pink, purple, or yellow, depending on the species. The
                        glossy, leathery leaves and cone-like fruit add to the plant's ornamental appeal. Fossil records
                        indicate that magnolias have existed for millions of years, predating bees, with beetles serving
                        as their primary pollinators. Symbolically, magnolias represent endurance, strength, and beauty.
                        In Chinese culture, they are associated with purity and nobility, often featured in art and
                        literature. In the southern United States, magnolias are emblematic of the region's natural
                        beauty and are frequently mentioned in songs and stories. According to folklore, magnolia trees
                        possess protective qualities, and planting one near a home is believed to safeguard the

                        are commonly used in gardens to deter pests, as their aroma is believed to repel insects.

                        believed to guide the spirits of the deceased back to the world of the living. In Hindu culture,

                        representing offerings to deities. According to Aztec legend, marigolds originated from the love

                        delicate markings resembling intricate patterns. The plant’s glossy, dark green leaves remain
                        vibrant year-round, adding to its appeal as an ornamental shrub. However, all parts of mountain
                        laurel are highly toxic to humans and animals if ingested. Symbolically, mountain laurel
                        represents perseverance, ambition, and protection. It was named after Pehr Kalm, a Swedish
                        botanist who studied North American flora in the 18th century. Indigenous peoples valued the
                        plant for its resilience, and it was sometimes used in ceremonies or as a protective charm.
                        According to Appalachian folklore, a young woman once wove a crown of mountain laurel to guide
                        her lost love home, but when he never returned, the flowers turned from white to pink,
                        reflecting her sorrow. Today, mountain laurel is cherished for its beauty and is even recognized
                        as the state flower of Pennsylvania and Connecticut.</td>

                        groups of flowering plants, with over 25,000 species worldwide. These perennial plants are found
                        on every continent except Antarctica, thriving in a wide range of habitats from tropical
                        rainforests to arid deserts. Orchid flowers are celebrated for their intricate shapes, vibrant
                        colors, and alluring fragrances, often adapted to attract specific pollinators. Many orchids are
                        epiphytic, growing on other plants for support without drawing nutrients from them, while others
                        are terrestrial, rooted in the soil. Throughout history, orchids have been symbols of love,
                        luxury, and beauty. In ancient Greece, they were associated with virility and fertility, while
                        in Victorian England, collecting and cultivating orchids became a symbol of status and
                        sophistication. In Chinese culture, orchids represent refinement and integrity, frequently
                        depicted in traditional art and poetry. A Scottish legend tells of orchids as powerful
                        talismans, believed to bring good luck and protect against the evil eye. Today, orchids remain
                        popular as ornamental plants and are often gifted to convey admiration and affection.</td>

                        These perennial shrubs or climbers can bloom in various seasons, depending on their species.
                        Originating from regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North
                        America, roses have been cultivated and cherished worldwide. The name "rose" comes from the
                        Latin "rosa," a term that has been embraced by many languages. With over three hundred species
                        and thousands of cultivars, roses are celebrated not only for their beauty and fragrance but
                        also for their culinary uses. They are edible in the sense that they can be made into rose
                        water, jam, and tea. Symbolizing a range of ideas, from love and beauty to passion and sorrow,
                        roses hold a special place in many cultures. In Greek mythology, the rose is linked to
                        Aphrodite, the goddess of love, who is said to have created the flower from her tears and the
                        blood of her lover, Adonis.</td>

                    <td>Sunflowers, scientifically known as Helianthus annuus, are tall, annual plants in the Asteraceae
                        family, native to North America. Characterized by their large, sun-like flower heads with bright
                        yellow petals surrounding a central disc, sunflowers are heliotropic, turning their blooms to
                        follow the sun's movement across the sky. They are cultivated for their edible seeds, which are
                        a source of oil and snacks, as well as for their striking appearance in gardens and floral
                        arrangements. Sunflowers are hardy plants that thrive in full sun and well-drained soil, often
                        reaching impressive heights during the growing season. Symbolically, sunflowers represent
                        adoration, loyalty, and longevity. In Greek mythology, the nymph Clytie was transformed into a
                        sunflower after pining for the Sun God Helios, eternally turning to face him as he moved across
                        the sky. In various cultures, sunflowers are seen as symbols of positivity and strength,
                        embodying the warmth and energy of the sun. Notably, the sunflower is the national flower of
                        Ukraine, symbolizing peace and resilience; during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, it
                        became a global emblem of solidarity and hope. Additionally, sunflowers have been used in art
                        and literature to convey themes of happiness and vitality, with artists like Vincent van Gogh
                        famously capturing their vibrant essence in his paintings.</td>
