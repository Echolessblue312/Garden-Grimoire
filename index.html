                <p>The lilac, or Syringa vulgaris, falls within the olive family, which also includes jasmine,
                    Forsythia, and privet.
                    It grows from a large deciduous shrub that blooms in spring. While it is native to the Balkan
                    Peninsula, it has been spread throughout parts of Asia, Europe, and North America.
                    The common name lilac descends from several different languages all the way back to the Persian
                    words meaning “indigo” or “dark blue”.
                    <br>There are over one thousand varieties of lilac and two hundred species. Lilacs are also edible
                    and can be made into things like lilac sugar, syrup, or even wine.
                    These flowers are symbols of love, hope, and new beginnings.
                    In Greek mythology, lilacs are said to have been formed from the tears of a nymph named Syringa, who
                    transformed herself into the very same plant to escape the unwanted advances of the Greek god named
                    Pan.

                <p>Roses, belonging to the Rosaceae family, share their lineage with apples, pears, and almonds.
                    These perennial shrubs or climbers can bloom in various seasons, depending on their species.
                    Originating from regions across the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, Asia, and North America,
                    roses have been cultivated and cherished worldwide.
                    The name "rose" comes from the Latin "rosa," a term that has been embraced by many languages.
                    <br>With over three hundred species and thousands of cultivars, roses are celebrated not only for
                    their beauty and fragrance but also for their culinary uses.
                    They are edible in the sense that they can be made into rose water, jam, and tea.
                    Symbolizing a range of ideas, from love and beauty to passion and sorrow, roses hold a special place
                    in many cultures.
                    In Greek mythology, the rose is linked to Aphrodite, the goddess of love, who is said to have
                    created the flower from her tears and the blood of her lover, Adonis.
